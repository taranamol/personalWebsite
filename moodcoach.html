              <h3> summary </h3>
              <p>The design process for Veteran’s Affairs’ Mood Coach was dictated by our user’s needs. We learned that Mood Coach’s target user is someone who lives with depression, has trouble staying motivated with everyday responsibilities, and believes in the power of self-help. Our solution is designed to address the needs of this target population by staying motivated during the toughest moments of depression. It features the ability to set daily tasks & goals with notifications allowing us to meet the user’s need of accountability. </p>

            <div class="col-sm-8 col-sm-offset-2 paragraph">
              <p> We began the design process by dissecting the client brief & understanding the business goals of addressing the current problem of low user engagement & usefulness in Mood Coach.  </p>

              <p> We learned there was a major constraint of being unable to save & share data since VA is a government organization. Because of this roadblock, it was difficult to know how well the application was doing & how the current population was interacting with it. This was a setback in our process because we had no information about Mood Coach’s user. However, by understanding that the application is aimed at helping everyone with depression, we had a foundation to begin our research.   </p>

              <p> Therefore, we began our research process by user interviews. This would help us understand the needs & pain points of our user. We quickly realized there was a theme within the interviews rooted in a difficulty of staying motivated with daily tasks & responsibilities. </p>

              <p>Next, we needed to understand what helped this population stay motivated during their toughest moments of depression. This geared our next set of interviews.</p>

We ideated solutions related to motivations & types of accountability.  </p>

              </div>
            <div class="col-sm-8 col-sm-offset-2 paragraph">

              <p>Concept prioritization of the essential & low-effort led us to realize that some concepts of accountability (such as external reminders, alarms, nudges, checklists, structure) would be easier to execute since they are already implemented in Mood Coach. However, Mood Coach’s execution of these elements still led low engagement & usefulness. </p>

              <h3> Usability Testing to understand low engagement & usefulness</h3>
              <p>From the informations gathered from our usability tests, we learned that overall confusion around onboarding process, what values were, how to set up plans was the cause of low engagement & usefulness. We continuously incorporated the data from our interviews to guide & validate our improvements of Mood Coach.</p>

             <h3>Ideating Solutions based on User Research</h3>
             <p>We gathered from usability tests, the main issue was confusion on the onboarding process, the significance of values, setting up plans, & general usability. </p>

             <p>We ideated different sketches of the solution based on our user interviews. We found that the changes implemented (streamlining onboarding, clarified plan set-up, & facilitated value-activity relationship) aligned with our users’ needs & thereafter, made Mood Coach more engaging & useful to them.</p>

            <h3> next steps </h3>

            <p>Although our current solution will address what we found to be the main user needs and business needs, there are certainly more concepts to be implemented in Mood Coach in order to ensure that users are being helped to the full potential. For instance, our research indicated that adding a component of community support would be essential for users’ motivation. This could be executed by adding a feature of anonymous news feed to Mood Coach, or the ability for a chosen “buddy” to log in to the user’s account and track their progress or leave an encouraging comment. </p>
