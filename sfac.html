                <h3>  day one | october 3, 2016</h3>
                <p>after receiving the project brief, we started off with doing research into what san francisco arts commission is. in order to truly understand what they do, we went into the field to talk to sfac.</p>

                <h4>FIELD RESEARCH</h4>
                <p>the first gallery was closed but we ended up talking to the guard who mentioned they sfac has a few galleries & the main person who runs the galleries will be there tomorrow. </p>

                <p>after googling what galleries might be open on, we ventured into sf city hall. the art commissioned by sfac was at the loading dock entrance on the bottom floor. we observed the gallery & talked to the city hall guard who said most people who come in are tourists. people ask about the sfac art gallery a few times a week. more so, in the evening. </p>

                <div class="width-image"> 
                  <img src="images/writer/sfac/cityhall.jpg">
                </div>
                <br><br>

                <p>the next gallery we went to was across city hall. it was a 24 hour glass building where there is a exhibition every few months. no sign/big notice to tell public it is an exhibition. while we were there, no one else came by to look at it. </p>

                 <div class="width-image"> 
                  <img src="images/writer/sfac/outsideex.jpg">
                </div>
                <br><br>

                <h4>COMPETITIVE ANALYSIS</h4>
                <p>on our way back to gather our notes/thoughts, we stumbled upon a  community arts program at hospitality house.</p>

                <div class="width-image"> 
                  <img src="images/writer/sfac/hh.jpg">
                </div>
                <br><br>

                <p>we spoke to an employee who told us anyone can come in. most people that come are from the ages of 30-70. kids don't usually come in unless they are with an adult. the space has art supplies, tables, computers, & many resources where the public can come in use art supplies to create art, use photoshop to create pieces, ceramics, etc. there are also a variety of classes that the center conducts. outside the center, there are displays of artwork from two different artists. they rotate the art every few months so there's opportunity to get different artists' work recognized & spread. between the artist' rotations, there's also themes of artwork that are put up for display. the next theme is #blacklivesmatter. </p>

                <p>there's two big auctions they conduct twice a way where bay area artists donate their art. the revenue that the auction brings helps them sustain the community art center. they also take donations & grants. </p>

                <p>stumbling upon this community center really helped us understand different ways that art can be used in the public space. </p>
             </div>


             <div class="col-sm-12">           
                <h3>  day two | october 4, 2016</h3>
                <p>on tuesday, we were still trying to grasp an understand of what sfac did. we did some research & found two organizations that they fund/collaborators. </p>

                <h4>UNDERSTANDING SFAC'S USERS</h4>
                <p>throughout the research, we found three types of users: </p>
                <ul>
                  <li>one is the artists. </li>
                  <li>one is the companies/organizations who are creating space for art.</li>
                  <li>one is the people/pedestrians who are engaging with the art. </li>
                </ul>
                
                <h4>EXPERT INTERVIEW | ALICE WU</h4>
                <p>next, we went into the field to talk to alice wu who is the interim education & public programs manager of sfac to conduct an expert interview.</p>

                <p>notes from expert interview with alice wu</p>
                <ul>
                  <li>some meetings are open to the public</li>
                  <li>sometimes people have concerns about upcoming public art installations</li>
                  <li>they have grants for artists</li>
                  <li>street artists can apply for grants</li>
                  <li>the exposition has three or four exhibits a year that rotate</li>
                  <li>it is all city funded, not always local artists</li>
                  <li>some projects are site specific & normally related to the city/ neighborhood </li>
                  <li>project guidelines vary from project to project </li>
                </ul>
             </div>

             
             <div class="col-sm-12">           
                <h3>  day three | october 5, 2016</h3>

                <h4>AFFINITY MAPPING</h4>
                <p>wednesday morning, we started off by doing affinity mapping to understand & synthesis research from insights over the last two days.</p>

                <p>the conclusions we had come to were: </p>

                <ul>
                <li>we learned demographic attraction is important (who is visiting the areas - tourist vs. citizen). tourists are going to the museums (finland art class that was in the main sfac gallery) & the guards also mentioned mostly tourist come to ask about where the paintings are. </li>
                <li>we learned there is a public disconnect with sfac. there are public meetings but they are often hard to find. not many people know about it. </li>
                </ul>

                <div class="width-image"> 
                  <img src="images/writer/sfac/am.jpg">
                </div>
                <br><br>

                <h4>EMPATHY MAPPING</h4>
                <p>furthermore, we did empathy mapping to understand pains/gains for sf residents.</p>

                <p>assumptions: </p>
                <ul>
                <li>the pains are a disconnect to sfac, their voice is not being heard. </li>
                <li>he gains would be to have a voice/say in the public art. </li>
                </ul>

                <h4>HYPOTHESIS BASED OFF AFFINITY MAPPING & EMPATHY MAPPING</h4>
                <p>after doing both the affinity map & empathy map, i came up with a hypothesis:</p>

                <p class="emphasizedtext">if we allow sf residents easier access/knowledge then they will become much more engaged/invested because they have stalk/voice to where their money/tax dollars are going.</p>

                <p>although, we had done some interviews, we wanted to engage with the public again & see if the assumptions throughout were valid. we separated & conducted surveys as well as in-depth interviews. </p>

                <h4>INTERVIEW #1</h4>
                <p>a few discussion points from interview #1</p>
                <ul>             
                <li>member of various art galleries/uses up free passes</li>
                <li>lives with an artist</li>
                <li>use to live with a bunch of graffiti artist</li>
                <li>looks at social media to find new art</li>
                <li>lives in the mission district</li>
                <li>doesn't think art should be controlled. doesn't think it's organic if it's controlled by the city. </li>
                <li>best interaction with public art was when there was a retainer wall & the city said keep it PC but anyone can come & put up art. this was amazing because they were extremely talented kids who have previously gotten arrested for street art but they were "so excited" to be a part of/express themselves on the wall. it was a great community building exercise. there were so many different types of people there from the elderly (who had prior called the police on the street artists) but were now working together with those same artists to build on wall. created a better tight knit community. </li>
                <li>artist who are typically represented in public art are those who have gone to a college, who have a piece of paper/degree. they are "privileged artists".  from the hood - only outlet is the environment & space around them & that environment is controlled by the government who have credentialed artists participating. street artists' portfolio "most of it has illegal content".</li>
                </ul>

                <h4>INTERVIEW #2</h4>
                <p>a few discussion points from interview #2</p>
                <ul>
                <li>born & raised in the mission district where there's lost of murals/history. it's been a part of him in providing style - graffiti artists. grew up drawing in city buses. lives in the playground of sf. </li>
                <li>two different types - street/public art that stays there longer because it's been commissioned by the city. art that goes away because it isn't commissioned by the city. </li>
                <li>the latter types of artist don't know who to contact. don't have resources or know how to connect to the city. 
                they don't trust the government. </li>
                <li>idea to get involvement: use walls as a bulletin board for a call to action "looking for an artist for this wall, send us your email" - getting the message to those who don't know how to contact the city. instead of waiting for artists to come to the city, have the city go to them. </li>
                <li> connect artist to places that need an artist. instead of giving jobs/commissions to an agency, give them artist who needs money. it will make the artist feel more connected to the city & a part of the city.</li>
                </ul>

                <h4>INTERVIEW #3</h4>
                <p>few discussion points from interview #3</p>
                <ul>
                <li>strong relationship with art - creative pursuit, mom is an architect. took photography classes throughout college & high school.</li>
                <li>very interested in graffiti - interested in public art/murals. likes to organically find art.</li>
                <li>graffiti - people who want to express their point of view/struggle/express their voice. their way of confronting the people who aren't listening.</li>
                <li>city should have an open dialogue with those artists - less strong penalties, don't criminalize their acts. artists are disenfranchised from the government/left out/want an outlet. city should recognize the feelings & address them. </li>
                </ul>

                <h4>AFFINITY MAPPING & MORE HYPOTHESIS'</h4>
                <p>after we did user interviews & surveys, we regrouped & did another round of affinity mapping which included the interviews we had just done. this led us to understand how are interviews are correlated with each other. once we talked about the interviews, we read our brief to make sure we were staying on track with our on a business goals. this helped us synthesis the design process we had gone through & create hypothesis.</p>

                <p>hypothesis: </p>
                <p class="emphasizedtext">if we allow sf residents/artists easier access to the city's public art decisions then they will become more engaged/invested because they have a stake/voice to where their money is going.</p>
                <p class="emphasizedtext">if we gain the trust of sf residents/artists in city/government they hey will be more inclined to participate because they feel safe & apart of the community.</p>

                <div class="width-image"> 
                  <img src="images/writer/sfac/hypothesis.jpg">
                </div>
                <br><br>

                <h4>INTERVIEW #4</h4>
                <p>few discussion points from interview #4 </p>
                <ul>
                <li>i produce music, particularly electronic/hip-hop</li>
                <li>public art spaces - they are usually started by people from the community to create a space - to give people an opportunity to create art. easier to schedule a gig with them. however, it's hard to become aware of these centers vs bars. you may physically live close to it but don't know about it until word of mouth/harder to find. </li>
                <li>they are funded for a specific quota they have to produce (media, number of programs, etc). to keep getting that funding, they have to meet the quota/there's limitations to what they can do. </li>
                <li> city should go out & find those people. rather than having the space itself alone. take the art/access to the neighborhoods/college that need it. </li>
                <li>the spaces themselves have to reflected of the community they are in. as a space, a major part of reaching out is how is going to solve this community's problem. </li>
                <li>example: 13 year old kid, parents don't come home till late, don't want to be in that neighborhood. how is that public art space going to help?</li>
                </ul>
               
             </div>

                <h3>  day four | october 6, 2016</h3>

                <p>thursday, we decided to synthesis the interview research into user scenario/personas.</p>

                <h4>TARGET USERS' BASED OFF OF USER INTERVIEWS</h4>
                <p>we have three different target users:</p>

                <li>artists who don't have access </li>
                </ul>
