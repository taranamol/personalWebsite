                  <h3> design studio prompt & motivation </h3>
                  <p>"Sexual Health: a broad umbrella that includes the most personal health issues that we all face, at many stages of our lives, across all gender identities and sexual orientations. These challenges are intensely personal, but politicized in American society. Too often they bring stigma and shame, especially at moments when people need care and support." -Organizer</p>

                  <p> Having a background working with marginalized communities & women, I was extremely excited for the possibilities in which design could increase access to sexual health. </p>

                 <div class="col-sm-12">
                  <h3>  affinity mapping </h3>
                  <p> We started the design studio with Affinity Mapping, a design tool to organize thoughts & group together similar categories. </p>

                  <p>On one side of the room, we wrote who were the stakeholders in sexual health & the other side encompassed post-it notes which targeted issues within sexual health. </p>

                  <p>As a group we then started as a group, we started to categorize both those involved & the issues to better understand similarities within the broad scope of sexual health. </p>

                  <h3> problem statement </h3>
                  <p> From there, we decided the target audience we wanted to design and build for. I gravitated to the group who was discussing immigrant women with children.</p>

                  <p>We went through the issues that affected this target audience & decided on the issue of education to better understand the situation & where in the process we as designers may build for. </p>

                  <p class="emphasizedtext">How to help immigrant women teach their children & themselves about sexual health? This was the core problem we were solving for. </p>

                  <h3>  brainstroming, persona, & user scenario </h3>
                  <p>We discussed the user & various experiences which embodied the persona we were designing for. This helped us center the needs and perspective of our user during the design process and also, know what scenarios we were designing for. Further, we separated for a few minutes & did a design process referred to as "Crazy 8".  This exercise is great when the designer is starting to brainstorm solutions. It's a timebox exercise where various solutions are drawn out. </p>

                  <p>We came back together & discussed each of the scenarios.</p>

                  <p>After, we separated for a minute to synthesize on one idea & expand on it.</p>

                  <p>We came back together again & discussed the ideas we had expanded on. As a group, we picked the features which made sense from the brainstorming session to create the MVP. </p>

                  <p>We then, sketched out the problem, persona & the solution we had developed. </p>
