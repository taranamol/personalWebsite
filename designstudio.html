    <!-- BACKGROUND-->  
  <div class="col-sm-12">
    <h3>  the purpose of a design studio</h3>

    <div class="col-sm-12">

      <p> As Will Evan's states "The Design Studio method has become one of the most successful methods in Agile and Lean UX. This rapid, iterative approach blends concept creation with critique. Design Studio is a great way to jumpstart your design process, create 300-400 design concepts in just a couple of hours, or get team buy-in and ownership."
        <br><br>
        This method is extremely useful at either part of the diamond. For this design studio the challenge was to build an app for promoting bay area events for the target audience of tourists. 
      <br><br>

        The Challenge: Commissioned by a joint stakeholder group that includes the Association of Bay Area Governments (ABAG), the San Francisco Chamber of Commerce, and other related organizations, to increase revenue in the region through a bay area-wide "events hub" (focus on current & upcoming events only).

  <!-- STEP ONE-->  
  <div class="col-sm-12">
    <h3>  step one | define the problem</h3>

    <div class="col-sm-8">

      <p>We started out by trying to understand the problem. Who was the business & what was their goal? What were they trying to accomplish? Who was the target audience? Trying to understand what pain points the target audience of tourists had when they were exploring a new city. 
        <br><br>
      A few of the pain points we talked about were:
      <br>
      Wi-Fi Access
      <br>
      Time Limitations
      <br>
      Location Services
      <br>
      Cost
      <br>
      Transportation
      <br>
      Food at Events
      <br>
      Cell Data Usage 
      <br>
      Personality of the Neighborhood
       </p>

      </div>

      <div class="col-sm-4 height-image">
        <img src="defineproblem.jpg">
      </div>

    </div>


    <!-- STEP TWO-->  
    <div class="col-sm-12">

      <h3>  step two | diverge </h3>

      <div class="col-sm-12">

        <p>After discussing as a group the limitations & pain points of the target audience, we indiviually (within a time box of 10 minutes), drew as many scenarios of solutions for the tourist. This design thinking method is commonly referred as "Crazy 8s". The purpose is to get everything - from the craziest ideas to the most normal ideas on a sheet of paper in the form of sketches. This allows for out of the box thinking of solutions for the user's problem.  </p>

        </div>  

        <div class="col-sm-8 col-sm-offset-2 width-image">
          <img src="diverge.jpg">
        </div>

      </div>



      <!-- STEP THREE-->  
      <div class="col-sm-12">
        <h3>  step three | critique </h3>

        <div class="col-sm-4 height-image">
          <img src="critque.jpg">
        </div>
        <div class="col-sm-8">

          <p>Next, we came together as a group to discuss each of the ideas. This allows the group to understand what the designer was thinking while they were sketching while giving constructive feedback. We realized that there were fundamental similarities within many of the ideas. Those similarities were about access. 
        <br><br>
          Many of the sketches were of the target user in spaces like airports, hotels, locations were the user would already inquire & receive information about the place they were in. The business goal revolved around gaining more participants & attendees at the events.
          <br><br> Therefore, providing a way for the user to receive information about the events while they were in the spaces that would be most convenient was a trend within all the sketches.  </p>

          </div>

        </div>


        <!-- STEP FOUR-->  
        <div class="col-sm-12">

          <h3>  step four | iterate/refine </h3>


          <div class="col-sm-12">

          <p>After discussing the similarities between the thought processes, we separated for another ten minutes to iterate on one final sketch which would take into consideration the best of the ideas from the group that kept the target user in mind. 

          <br><br>The idea I decided to iterate on was of an interactive screen which would be set up in tourist hotspots. The interactive screen would have information about the location & upcoming events. There would be a wealth of information for each event such as timing, how far it was from the current location, what the neighborhood was like. Ideally, all the major pain points which were discussed in step one. The area around the interactive screen would be a hotspot for WI-FI since access to internet when traveling isn't a guarantee. </p>

            </div>  

            <div class="col-sm-8 col-sm-offset-2 width-image">
              <img src="refine.jpg">
            </div>

          </div>



          <!-- STEP FIVE-->  
          <div class="col-sm-12">
            <h3>  step five | converge</h3>

            <div class="col-sm-12">

          <p>Next, we came together as a group, discussed all of the iterations we had just done. After presenting each of our ideas, we talked about what parts of each iteration seemed to make sense & made it into one app. This would be an app on all different mediums such as iPad, iPhone, as well as an interactive screen. The app would be the same with the same capabilities of filtering through events & providing information for each events & events in the area. </p>

          <div class="col-sm-12">
            <h3>key takeaways from the design studio workshop </h3>

            <div class="col-sm-12">

           <p>The design studio process is done depending on what process the designer is in. My main takeaway was the it helps when it's the beginning of something: to start generating ideas. A way to start thinking about solutions. <br><br>

            A way to understand all the information that has been gathered & see in which part of the scenario the designer should be creating a solution. After this, depending on which level the sketches(conceptual vs. detailed), there a different next steps. <br><br>

            For example, if the ideas originating in the design studio were conceptual, maybe an interview is a next step to validate if the concepts which came up in the situations actually are the ones the target user is in. Are they represented?

            If it's detailed, maybe paper prototypes are next. Testing the detailed interactions & if they make sense. </p>
