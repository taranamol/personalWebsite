                  <h3>  the purpose of a design studio</h3>

                  <p>Design studio is a way of working as a team to rapidly ideate solutions and leverage individual creativity and group strategy.</p>
                  <p> As Will Evan's states "The Design Studio method has become one of the most successful methods in Agile and Lean UX. This rapid, iterative approach blends concept creation with critique. Design Studio is a great way to jumpstart your design process, create 300-400 design concepts in just a couple of hours, or get team buy-in and ownership."</p>

                  <p>This method does not need to be done at a specific point; it can be  extremely useful when (one part of diamond) or (other part).  I would like to highlight an example.</p>

                  <p>The Challenge: Commissioned by a joint stakeholder group that includes the Association of Bay Area Governments (ABAG), the San Francisco Chamber of Commerce, and other related organizations, to increase revenue in the region through a bay area-wide "events hub" (focus on current & upcoming events only). In other words, the design challenge was to create an app that promoted bay area events for tourists (one of two main target users).</p>

                <!-- STEP ONE-->  
                <div class="col-sm-8">
                  <h3>  step one | define the problem</h3>
                   <p>We started out by trying to understand the problem: Who was the business & what was their goal? What were they trying to accomplish? Who was the target audience? We focused on trying to understand what pain points the target audience of tourists had when they were exploring a new city. </p>
                   <p>A few of the pain points we talked about were:</p>
                   <ul>
                    <li> Wi-Fi Access</li>
                    <li> Time Limitations</li>
                    <li>Location Services</li>
                    <li>Cost</li>
                    <li>Transportation</li>
                    <li> Food at Events</li>
                    <li>Cell Data Usage </li>
                    <li> Personality of the Neighborhood</li>
                  </ul>
                </div>

                <div class="col-sm-4 height-image">
                  <img src="images/writer/designstudio/defineproblem.jpg">
                </div>
       


                <!-- STEP TWO-->  
                <div class="col-sm-12">
                  <h3>  step two | diverge </h3>
                  <p>After discussing as a group the limitations & pain points of the target audience, we individually,drew as many scenarios of solutions for the tourist within a span of ten minutes. This design thinking method is commonly referred as "Crazy 8s". The purpose is to get everything - from the craziest ideas to the most normal ideas - on a sheet of paper in the form of sketches. This allows for out of-the-box thinking of solutions that address the  user's problem.  </p>
                </div>  

                <div class="col-sm-12 width-image">
                  <img src="images/writer/designstudio/diverge.jpg">
                </div>


                <!-- STEP THREE-->  
                <div class="col-sm-12">
                  <h3>  step three | critique </h3>
                  <div class="col-sm-4 height-image">
                    <img src="images/writer/designstudio/critque.jpg">
                  </div>
                  <div class="col-sm-8">
                   <p>Next, we came together as a group to discuss each of the ideas. This allows the group to understand what each designer's perspective . We realized that there were fundamental similarities within many of the ideas - the concept of access. Many of the sketches were of the target user in spaces like airports, hotels, locations where the user would already inquire & receive information about the place they were in. We knew that the business goal revolved around increasing revenue by gaining greater number of  participants & attendees at events. As a result, we saw an overarching theme of an app that provided a way for the user to receive information about the events while they were in the spaces that would be most convenient.  </p>
                 </div>
                </div>


                 <!-- STEP FOUR-->  
                 <div class="col-sm-12">
                  <h3>  step four | iterate/refine </h3>
                  <p>After discussing our various perspectives on the solution, we separated for another ten minutes to iterate on one final sketch which would take into consideration the best of the ideas from the group that kept the target user in mind. I was interested in iterating on  an interactive screen concept which would be set up in tourist hotspots. The screen would have information about the location & upcoming events. There would be a wealth of information for each event such as timing, how far it was from the current location, what the neighborhood was like, and any other categories that addressed , the major pain points listed above. We also wanted to provide an option for accessing WI-FI hotspots I when access to internet when traveling isn't possible. </p>

                <!-- STEP FIVE-->  
                <div class="col-sm-12">
                  <h3>  step five | converge</h3>
                  <p>Next, we came together as a group to discuss each of our individual  iterations. We then discussed aspects  of each iteration that would address the core problem the app is looking to solve. This would be an app on all different media  such as iPad, iPhone, as well as an interactive screen. The app would be the same with the same capabilities of filtering through events & providing information for each events & events in the area. </p>

                  <h3>key takeaways from the design studio workshop </h3>
                  <p>My main takeaway from the exercise was the it helps when it's the beginning of something: to start generating ideas. A way to start thinking about solutions.  </p>
                  <p>However, the Design Studio process can be done at any stage designers see as appropriate to leverage individual thinking and group consensus. Designers are equipped with many tools to be able to extract meaningful insights and need to understand when a method is appropriate. For example, if the ideas originating in the design studio were conceptual, maybe an interview is a next step to validate if the concepts which came up in the situations actually are the ones the target user is in. Are they represented?</p>
                  <p>A way to understand all the information that has been gathered & see in which part of the scenario the designer should be creating a solution. After this, depending on which level the sketches(conceptual vs. detailed), there a different next steps. If it's detailed, maybe paper prototypes are next. Testing the detailed interactions & if they make sense. </p>
