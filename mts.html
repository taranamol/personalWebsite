              <h3> the problem </h3>
              <h4> competitive analysis - understanding what other businesses are doing</h4>
              <p>With a few keys things in mind, I started the design process with trying to understand other companies within the field & in e-commerce. In order to do this, I completed a competitive analysis which is a UX tool comparing, in this case, various items on the page/website such as feature comparison, element analysis, layout comparison to understand which sites do well & why they do well.</p>
              <p>Once I had a grasp of competitors within the field & those who are doing e-commerce well, I realized that the checkout function is one of the key pages within the site. Being able to find a product & checkout in a seamlessly optimal way made or broke the experience. </p>

              <h4>site map - understanding information architecture </h4>

              <p>My next step was to do a closed card sort because although I narrowed the categories down, I needed to make sure those were the right categories. A closed cart sort is where the categories are picked ahead of time & in this case, the user would place the toys in pre-determined categories (which were based on the open card sort). </p>

              <p>I started off with two open card sorts, I wanted to understand how these toys would be grouped in the user's mind. Once the card sorts had some categories, I did some more competitive analysis to understand what other companies were naming those categories. </p>

              <h4> user flow - understanding the target audience </h4>

              <p>After understanding the competition & the business, I needed to understand my user: the target audience. I went through the personas they had provided to create create efficient means for purchasing products & created user flows. </p>

              <p>This helped me comprehend what pages & functionality was the most integral on the site & what was needed. However, with this I realized some of the navigation wouldn't be as clear to an avid toy lover/lover of vintage toys.</p>

              <p>So I set out to do another closed card sort with a lover of toys. After the card sort, I set up a user interview to understand why they placed some toys where & what they were thinking.</p>

              <p>The biggest discovery I had from this card sort was many of the toys that I was having difficulty placing in a category went in "Retro/Classic". I knew this because everytime my user stumbled upon one of these, their response would be "OHMYGOD, I use to play this all the time, it's totally a classic toy". </p>

              <div class="col-sm-12">
                <h3> the solution </h3>
                <h4>wireframes - organizing neccessary information for the target audience</h4>
                <p>Next, I wanted to see what content was available & how to structure where toy lovers could easily checkout. In order to organize the information that had been gathered, I created wireframes which will help map out the user flow visually. </p>
                <p>I used the competitive analysis to understand what was important & how Magic Toy Shop wanted to stay unique but also best practices of the industry. I set up the navigation from the card sort activity organizing the information in a comprehendible way. I used the personas to create the priorities & importance of the website. All of this funneled into the wireframes & mockups.</p>

                <h4>product testing - testing the usability</h4>
                <p>From there, I did some product testing where users went through the wireframes & early iterations of the prototype to understand what was confusing for the user. This was extremely helpful in understanding the interaction of the user & what was missing. </p>
