            <div class="col-sm-12">
              <p>  This case study is about the client, Magic Toy Shop. They are a retailer focusing on toys, games & magic tricks starting to incorporate new & upcoming toys. With their long-standing history of providing vintage & cherished items they wanted to remake their website to show their treasure chest of toys.</p>
            </div>


            <div class="col-sm-12">
              <h3> COMPETITIVE ANALYSIS - UNDERSTANDING WHAT OTHER BUSINESSES ARE DOING </h3>
              <p>With a few keys things in mind, I started the design process with trying to understand other companies within the field & in e-commerce. In order to do this, I completed a competitive analysis which is a UX tool comparing, in this case, various items on the page/website such as feature comparison, element analysis, layout comparison to understand which sites do well & why they do well.</p>
              <p>Once I had a grasp of competitors within the field & those who are doing e-commerce well, I realized that the checkout function is one of the key pages within the site. Being able to find a product & checkout in a seamlessly optimal way made or broke the experience. </p>
            </div>


            <div class="col-sm-12">
              <h3>SITE MAP - UNDERSTANDING INFORMATION ARCHITECTURE </h3>
              <p>Once I had a grasp of what the e-commerce/toy industry consisted of, I needed to understand how the user was thinking as well as where they would go to find the items. </p>
              <p> I did a card sort, which is UX technique where the categories are written on flash cards/post-it notes & the user organizes them into groups that make sense to them. I wrote the 100 most popular items on the flash cards. Organizing the toys was an important step because this would help the user find the product easily & buy it. </p>

              <div class="width-image"> 
                <img src="images/designer/mts/alejandra_closed_sort.jpg">
              </div>
              <br><br>

              <p>I started off with two open card sorts, I wanted to understand how these toys would be grouped in the user's mind. Doing both of the open card sorts, I realized that there were many ways one would organize them. Once the card sorts had some categories, I did some more competitive analysis to understand what other companies were naming those categories. </p>
              <p>My next step was to do a closed card sort because although I narrowed the categories down, I needed to make sure those were the right categories. A closed cart sort is where the categories are picked ahead of time & in this case, the user would place the toys in pre-determined categories (which were based on the open card sort). </p>

            </div>


            <div class="col-sm-12">
              <h3> USER FLOW  - UNDERSTANDING THE TARGET AUDIENCE </h3>
              <div class="col-sm-4 height-image">
                <img src="images/designer/mts/t_user_flow.PNG">
              </div>
              <div class="col-sm-8">
                <p>After understanding the competition & the business, I needed to understand my user: the target audience. I went through the personas they had provided to create create efficient means for purchasing products. I did many iterations of user flows (which is mapping out how the user would complete a task) to understand what was necessary for the user to get from point a to point b.</p>
                <p>This helped me comprehend what pages & functionality was the most integral on the site & what was needed. However, with this I realized some of the navigation wouldn't be as clear to an avid toy lover/lover of vintage toys.</p>
                <p>So I set out to do another closed card sort with a lover of toys. After the card sort, I set up a user interview to understand why they placed some toys where & what they were thinking.</p>
                <P>The biggest discovery I had from this card sort was many of the toys that I was having difficulty placing in a category went in "Retro/Classic". I knew this because everytime my user stumbled upon one of these, their response would be "OHMYGOD, I use to play this all the time, it's totally a classic toy". </p>

             </div>


              <div class="col-sm-8">
                <h3>WIREFRAMES - ORGANIZING NECCESSARY INFORMATION FOR THE TARGET AUDIENCE</h3>
                <p>Next, I wanted to see what content was available & how to structure where toy lovers could easily checkout. In order to organize the information that had been gathered, I created wireframes which will help map out the user flow visually. </p>
                <p>I used the competitive analysis to understand what was important & how Magic Toy Shop wanted to stay unique but also best practices of the industry. I set up the navigation from the card sort activity organizing the information in a comprehendible way. I used the personas to create the priorities & importance of the website. All of this funneled into the wireframes & mockups.</p>

                <h3>PRODUCT TESTING - TESTING THE USABILITY </h3>
                <p>From there, I did some product testing where users went through the wireframes & early iterations of the prototype to understand what was confusing for the user. This was extremely helpful in understanding the interaction of the user & what was missing. </p>
