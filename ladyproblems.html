                  <h4>User Interviews</h4>
                  <p>We validated the challenges by interviewing various women who work in different industries. This also helped us narrow down the scope of our primary users & dig deeper into workplace culture. </p>

                  <p>After our first round of user interviews, we learned women face a range of problems which stem from:</p>

                  <ul>
                  <li>Patriarchal society</li>
                  <li>Stereotypical female/male-centric way of thinking</li>
                  <li>Lack of counsel & knowledge in knowing how to maneuver around work politics</li>
                  <li>Lack of confidence because they don't feel supported</li>
                  </ul>

                  <p>In the second round of interviews, we explored different support groups women have. Our goal was to understand their perspective on accountability/support & community.  We spoke with women to understand the who, the why, the how, what has worked, what can be important.</p>

                  <h4> target user </h4>
                  <p> Women who are just starting their career out of college. </p>

                  <h4>issues they face </h4>
                  <p>They are unaware how to navigate through work politics, negotiation, & finance. Often times, they don't know where to start or what actions they can take to improve their career. </p>

                  <h4>core problem </h4>
                  <p>Women lack confidence in the workplace. One of the reasons they feel this way is because they lack inside knowledge as a working professional.  </p>
