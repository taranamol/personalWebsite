              <!-- PROBLEM-->  
              <div class="col-sm-12">
                <h3>  the problem </h3>
                <h4>  user interviews </h4>
                <p> After conducting our first few interviews, we quickly realized there were many diverse users who had contradictory goals. In order to address the problem thoroughly, we needed to focus on one set of those user goals. We narrowed our focus to the target audience of San Francisco artists who did not have a formal education in the arts but have a deep appreciation & talent for it. </p>

                <p>Through our next interview set, in which we concentrated on this target audience, two key factors came up continuously: resources & opportunities. Our target users' primary needs weren't being meet. They did not have the resources such as space, time, and money to create art.</p>

                <p>Numerous artists interviewed mentioned they didn't trust the government. Many of them within this community had been incarcerated or fined for their public art. Due to this interaction, they did not have a positive perception of the local government. </p>

                <p class="emphasizedtext"> Since their interaction was limited to these instances, they did not know that SFAC offered the same resources (space, money, supplies, etc.) that they needed. This lack of trust was the problem we needed to solve by providing them with resources & opportunities.</p>

                <h4>  business goals </h4>
                <p> Further, there was the business goal of SFAC in which they wanted to increase civic engagement and transparency. We needed to bridge the gap between the business goals & the user goals. </p>

              </div>


              <!-- SOLUTION-->  
              <div class="col-sm-12">
                <h3> the solution </h3>
                <p class="emphasizedtext"> The primary business goal our solution will address is to provide opportunities for local artists to participate in public art events through SFAC's website. </p>

                <p class="emphasizedtext">The primary user goal our solution supports is to build trust and engage local artists' with regards to the resources and information SFAC has to offer.</p>

                <h4>  digital medium </h4>
                <p>The way we did this was through a redesign of SFAC's Public Art website. We chose a digital medium because would have the widest impact and audience. We used visual design to emphasize the opportunities SFAC had for the target audience. We prioritized the needs of our users at the core of the website: the front page. </p>

                <p>By highlighting the ways SFAC could help, the target user will feel more inclined to participate because their primary goal of resources & opportunities would be met. </p>

                <p>We targeted this audience through a very straightforward & short application process (for which no education or prior work was necessary) since many of them have no official educational degree. </p>

                <p>We placed the decision process on the front page as well as throughout the application form, allowing the artist to know exactly how projects are picked. </p>

                <p>In addition to the transparent decision process, there would be public meetings where the neighborhood is invited to vote & help decide what art will be displayed. This way the artist & neighborhoods will have increased ownership over what art is being placed where in their communities. </p>

                <p>This is true community building where we reflect on the expectations and aspirations of all local stakeholders and truly connect them with government resources. </p>
